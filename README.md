# SCT_DS_TASK1
📊 Task 1: Data Visualization of Youth Labor Force Participation

📝 Project Overview
This task explores the labor force participation rate (LFPR) of young males aged 15–24 across countries using data visualization. Through effective charts and plots, I examined patterns, trends, and outliers in global youth employment from 2010 to 2024.

🎯 Objectives

•Understand categorical vs continuous variables.

•Use Python to clean, filter, and explore real-world labor data.

•Communicate trends in labor force participation visually.

•Practice creating plots that tell stories with data.

📁 Dataset Used

•Source: World Bank (Youth Labor Force Participation - Age 15–24, Male)

•Years Covered: 2010–2024

•Fields: Country Name, Year, Participation Rate (%), Region

📊 Visualizations Created

📌 Categorical Variable Visualizations

•Top 20 Countries by Labor Force Participation (Age 15–24, Male) - 2024.

•Top 10 Countries by Average Labor Force Participation (2010–2024).

•Bottom 10 Countries by Avg Participation (2010–2024).

•Top Countries with Decline in Youth Labor Participation (2010–2024).

•Top 10 Countries with Highest Participation Variability (2010–2024).

•Top 10 Most Stable Countries in Labor Participation (2010–2024).

•Number of Countries by Participation Bracket (2024).

•Participation in 2015 (Bar Plot).

📌 Continuous Variable Visualizations

•Distribution of Labor Force Participation Rates (Male, Age 15–24) - 2024.

•Global Median Labor Force Participation Trend (2010–2024).

•Distribution of Average Participation (2010–2024).

•Histogram & KDE of Participation Rates (2024).

•Sample Age Distribution (15–24) (Simulated dataset).

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

•Python

•Pandas – for data cleaning and manipulation.

•Matplotlib – for custom visualizations.

•Seaborn – for advanced statistical plots.

•NumPy – for simulated age data generation.

🔍 Key Insights

•Labor participation among youth varies significantly across countries and over time.

•Some countries show consistent engagement while others exhibit high volatility.

•A clear decline in participation is visible in several top economies post-2015.

•Data visualization makes trends and gaps in global youth employment visible at a glance.

🎓 Key Learnings

•Differentiated and visualized categorical vs continuous data effectively.

•Applied real-world labor data to create compelling insights.

•Strengthened skills in bar plots, histograms, KDE, and trendlines.

•Practiced communicating data stories through visual summaries.
